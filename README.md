The study involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 24 features, such as iron and silica percentages, to pinpoint crucial variables. Various statistical and deep learning models were employed for time series forecasting, including ARIMA, VARIMA, Vanilla RNN, LSTM, and Stacked LSTM. Among these, the Stacked LSTM model stood out, featuring three hidden layers with 30 neurons each and a timestep of 6 hours. It outperformed other models, achieving an R-squared score of 0.59. This comprehensive analysis suggests that the Stacked LSTM configuration effectively captures the complex patterns within the data, offering superior predictive capabilities for the given task. The findings highlight the significance of deep learning techniques, particularly Stacked LSTMs, in handling intricate time series data and forecasting outcomes with a notable degree of accuracy.
